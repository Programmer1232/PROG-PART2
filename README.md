In my app I have put in a button that gives you an option to add a claim that you want to receive from the company After you have created a claim, you go to have you claim approved or declined then a have an option where you can upload supporting documents of your claim which can either be in word or pdf so it can much simpler for the company to see what is in it without any complications when you have uploaded everything the client gets to see if their claim has been approved or declined by the company
